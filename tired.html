Of having to subserviate myself to people who don't even acknowledge my existence. Of having to make the conscious decision to hold space&mdash; space that I am repeatedly promised, but only in theory, never in practice. I'm tired of the reaction when we collide, bitterness that I didn't yield to begin with and confusion in the internalised expectation.</p>
                
                <p class="t-white t-normiefont@xs t-normiefont@s t-normiefont@m t-normiefont@l t-normiefont@xl t-serifweight"><span class="t-titlingfont">I'm tired of not being viewed.</span> Of having to choose to be seen for my gender or for my race. Of having to accommodate to Westernised standards of beauty and of being defined on binaries that never counted me as a one but as a zero. I'm tired of being seen only in parts, and never in whole. A supporting actor, always.</p>

Or in a rare instance when it is heard, it is repackaged in a larger box, with more packaging with someone else's name on it. That palatable, approachable box delivers.</p>

                <p class="t-white t-normiefont@xs t-normiefont@s t-normiefont@m t-normiefont@l t-normiefont@xl t-serifweight"><span class="t-titlingfont">I'm tired of not being felt.</span> Of having to defend the truth my lived experiences with data and screenshots and typed out summaries of paragraphs from those who came before me who survived similar things. Just to have it all invalidated as hyperbole or as outrage. I'm met with the requirement to listen to the intents and the meanings and the intents and meanings and intents and the meanings without ever being asked just once&mdash;what kind of impact that it might have had on me.</p>

I'm tired of being told that the right person will come along; that the loneliness of being single will pass from people who will return home to the comfort of their significant others. I'm tired of being told that the right company will finally see my worth and will hire me, if I just hold out, from people who can expect their paycheck on Friday from their steady jobs.</p>

And how your complicit silence hurts more than explicit slurs.</p>

Of having to hear how my brown thoughts are overreactions or misconceptions in their white world. Of having to hold space for feelings as so many of us face an imminent fear of death.</p>

In a world where I have to crawl on the backs of people who look like me; people who are struggling in the same and in different ways. Because my existence doesn't work that way. I exist in a world of ands and withs, being multitudes and holding opinions that seem like contradictions where more than one truth can exist&mdash;it is a world of abundance, of not only resources, but of perspectives and of truths.</p>

Of being cautiously optimistic as I am seared into pessimism. Of seeking love and happiness in a world that returns me so much hate and sadness.
