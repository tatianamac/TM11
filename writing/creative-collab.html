Creative Collaboration: Interview with FredÂ Deakin
https://vimeo.com/106860458
Fred Deakin has worked in the creative field as a musician, designer, and most recently an educator at University of the Arts, London (UAL), where he is Professor of Interactive Digital Arts.
In our interview we hear about the dynamism of the creative process and why collaboration is an absolute necessity for all fields, not just creative. We learn about Fred's experiences working collaboratively within interactive design (in his "real world" workshop for his UAL students), and beyond (as a DJ, musician, and regular contributor to various art installations).
