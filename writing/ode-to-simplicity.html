A designer's ode to simplicity
I took a lot of math in college. There are generally two types of math classes: theory-based and applications-based. Though enjoy my partial differential equations professor I did, I found (and still find) math with a 'use' to be the most challenging. I get bored with the calculations, frustrated with the lack of emphasis on deriving the equations on which you so heavily rely and I inevitably will royally butcher any arithmetic you through my way. I favored theory-based classes, where concepts were the emphasis. Bizarre as it was to add cloud to purple, I felt like I just 'got' this part of math - the side where there's no silly songs to embed arbitrary equations into your mind; the side that teaches you all variables are just that; so why not just call it hat when x means just as little or just as much; and the side that forces you to draw the connection between math and philosophy and ethics (A:B:C).
The biggest lesson I learned in math was the one it taught me on beauty. Math can yes literally quantify beauty (so says Da Vinci), but for me it exemplifies beauty in its perpetual search for simplicity. Whether dealings in algebra or complex variables, the steps you take are always guided by the cardinal direction of simplification. You cancel numbers, group like terms, rationalize, irrationalize, use distribution laws - all to turn independent ingredients into one coherent dish. Sometimes the journey requires you to backtrack; take north by northwest before you head towards simple south, but if done correctly, you'll always find your way back.
It always amazed me how the search could sometimes be straightforward and other times grueling. Pages and pages of paper-thin paper, leathery and fragile by aggravated erasing. It was more often than not just a test of patience, but the prize was always worth it: 1 > 0 or x =x or 5 =5. A cheeky nod that all those sweat and tears (math draws blood on rare, Count Dracula-worthy occasions) only really tells you something that you already know. Hell, people who don't even like math or are particularly good at math know those conclusions.
This lesson has carried beyond the world of symbols and numbers (and household objects that are topologically similar) to nearly everything else in my life. Almost everything I love is simple. Damn Martha, but she's right. Know it or not, most humans crave simplicity. It's the path of least resistance, usually.
Simplicity in Art
In art, I am attracted to pieces with little ornamentation. It's harder for the masses to appreciate them, because of the my sadly and widely believed "[insert anyone believed to not be able to create art] could do that" principle. The intrigue isn't in the technical and academic skills (which, might I point out, many of the artists who choose to paint 'simply' posess in spades) but rather in how little we need to recognize something. Any two similar dots and a third line/fragment/blob, and I guarantee you you'll spot the face. We all know that when a kid draws a asterisk, it's snow (yet when the late Kurt Vonnegut did it, it meant something else).
Hard to select just a few favorite pieces, but the movements to which I was initially drawn - and still am most drawn - were indisputably (who is actually disputing?) Russian constructivism and (its foster child of sorts) German Bauhaus. What I appreciate about both movements likely stems from a graphic design perspective: like pigments and pixels are grouped to create bold and provocative images. No tenebristic tendencies, nothing fading in or out, but a ballsy assertion that everything can be reduced to shapes and colours (or Kadinsky's even more reduced point, line and plane).
Circles in a circle, Wassily KandinskyMore classes led me to appreciate every movement that came before that ultimately allowed those two movements to evolve, particularly the Dutch Golden Age. The shapes had not yet been reduced (mixed fractions and whatnot), but you can begin to see what was there before Mondrian strip(p)ed it down to its primary parts (and colours) - you can glimpse the skeleton of simplicity, just maybe masked by some stocky Dutch farm babes and their milk jugs. (Even further, you can see the essence of form at the root of one of my favorite paintings, Oath of the Horatii, it's merely a series of thirds represented by different shapes, and light and absence of light, which arguably could be a binary form in itself).
Oath of the Horatii, Jacques-Louis DavidSimplicity in Literature
In literature, I appreciate the thousands of layers that David Foster Wallace can pile on. I like creating constellations when connecting his thoughts. I also appreciate Henry James' sometimes very subtle sexual undertones beneath his overt sexual overtones. And Tolstoy and the Bröntes and Eliot and Proust and Faulkner - where to begin. Rich millers of words. What I love most is the familiar textile of Mr John Steinbeck; a muslin or cotton at best. His novels and novellas tend follow that old tenet of writing about what he knows. He knows Salinas Valley: its characters, its landscape, its weather, its colours and its secrets. Even his themes tend to favor the open-ended and eternal - love, hate, friendship, wealth.
East of Eden, the greatest book I'll ever read, is simply about unconditional love. Though a more widely-woven author, he daftly creates rich characters that you can't let go of because you're never 100 percent sure that you like or dislike him or her. (Even complex characters are usually polarizing to me). I found myself hating Catherine James only to discover something about her that made me feel awful for ever having a negative thought. He accomplishes this not by colorful or detailed imagery, but by carefully chosen descriptions. He simplifies what could be thousands of pages (if he were Ayn Rand, in particular) into a simple simple sentence (both inferences of the word).
Simplicity in Music
In music, I listen to music that resolves. I have trouble with off downbeats and a lot of syncopation and 2/3 / 2 time and diminished seventh minor chords. To borrow a line, I want every minor fall to have a major lift. I enjoy repetitive rhythms and rhymes; electronica and pop are comforting in their respective predictability. I don't mind that Pachelbel's Canon in D is the premise for most karaoke songs I like. From the day I learned of sonatas in piano, I never wanted to stop learning them: I loved the exposition, development and recapitulation that I could predict in every piece.
Simplicity is often seen as the antithesis of sophistication. So long as there are parties with chocolate fountains and ice sculptures, and women dressed in yards of taffeta, my love for the minimal - the simple - will be sometimes viewed as frugal or lacking imagination or, worst of all, plain. I strive to make every element count. I want everything to feel like it's paying its rent on the page. I humbly contend that simplicity is anything but plain. It is sometimes serendipitous and easy. Other times, it is challenge. Finding it can take nearly a lifetime of mucking through complexity. Once you stumble upon it though, everything else seems to be the worst kind of challenge; a journey towards the wrong way.
Everything - everything - can be made better by simplification. For non-living things, well, they too are best appreciated when allowed to flourish in their unadulterated and purest forms; as a balanced equation, a lone line, a perfectly-arched phrase, a three-ingredient salad. For us living beings you can still argue we're here to procreate in order to perfect our species in a Darwinian sense as an ends, but our means is to create a semblance of order out of the chaos of the universe, and egocentrically, to create a person free of complexity. In a world where we're asked to do more and provide more options, this is a search I believe we all have within us. We can shed ourselves of the extra variables, rid of our irrationals, distribute, cancel, and group like terms. To live in the most richly simple way we possibly can.
