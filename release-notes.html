                <p class="t-white">Launched my <a class="t-link-accent-pink" href="https://www.patreon.com/tatianamac/"
                        target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patreon</a>, so this update was fueled by adding a
                    sponsorship section to reflect that. Adding a section visually impacted flow, which gave me a chance
                    to explore the extended colour palette.</p>

                    <li>Added section for sponsorship to both encourage new patronage and to thank current ones.</li>

                    Systems</h3>
                <ul class="longform">
                    <li>In some CSS explorations, I learned that <code>filter</code> can't be compounded. But, because
                        it has overlap qualities with <code>box-shadow</code>, I doubled them up for this fun 8-bit
                        effect to highlight top-level sponsors. It's a progressive enhancement, so I'm less concerned
                        about the fact that its browser support isn't across the board.</li>
                    <li>A friendly reminder to myself that I should always just write my full <code>@mixins</code>.
                        Because I structured my CSS to media-query at the component level (in markup), I always end up
                        needing that flexibility. I get lazy sometimes and always regret it. I really enjoyed
                        refactoring my CSS this way.</li>
                </ul>

                    Security</h3>
                <ul class="longform">
                    <li>Added <code>noreferrer</code> and <code>noopener</code> to all my external links. Lots of nuance
                        here, but tl;dr is that in doing so, it does not allow browsing data to be passed forward to the
                        site being opened and closes vulnerabilities of opening a new browser window when using
                        <code>target="_blank"</code>, respectively. Because I don't care to invade my users' privacy,
                        this has no impact on my analytics. People who want to steal information about their users by
                        way of Google Analytics and other tracking should avoid this. Also, I learned that this doesn't
                        have a negative SEO impact, which many misunderstand it to.</li>

                <p class="t-white">Tax day release (why should I pay taxes to a corrupt government with a president who
                    doesn't pay taxes?) made some substantial improvements to accessibility and performance. Inspired
                    what I learned at <a class="t-link-accent-pink" href="https://perfmattersconf.com/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noreferrer noopener">PerfMatters</a>, I implemented some major performance improvements.
                </p> I also learned a lot about semantic HTML, which improved the site's accessibility.</p>

                <ul class="longform">
                    <li>Added Canary in a Coal Mine to writing section.</li>
                    <li>Built out speaking section into its own tier for past and future gigs! Very proud of the fun use
                        of CSS <code>radial-gradients()</code> and <code>outline</code> to get the stamp effect. In
                        unsupported browsers, it has more of a puzzle piece feel, which I dig.</li>
                    <li>Added city stamps to show first (!) international speaking gigs! First time experimenting with
                        SVG <code>textPaths</code>. The semantics are odd to me; will need to read more. Also, when
                        running standard accessibility tests, it can get confused about contrast checking, so I had to
                        manually check.</li>
                    <li>Built out about section into its own tier. Rewrote it to be a more coherent bio.</li>

                    <li>Changed all raster <code>&lt;imgs&gt;</code> from JPGs to WEBPs. In order to make sure browsers
                        that don't support WEBP, I used to <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;source&gt;</code>
                        to build in appropriate fallbacks. Building all those image stacks was a bitch, but online image
                        generators helped me out there.</li>
                    <li>Added <code>srcsets</code> so that the appropriate image size is served up. <a
                            class="t-link-accent-pink" href="https://css-tricks.com/responsive-images-css/"
                            target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Coyier's article on responsive images</a>
                        was so helpful!</li>
                    <li>Replaced the heavy-ass Taco Bell gif with a cute SVG. Ultimately from a content perspective, it
                        wasn't offering its performance weight. Bye boi, bye.</li>
                    <li>Minified all my code: SVGs (using Jake Archibald's <a class="t-link-accent-pink"
                            href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/" target="_blank"
                            rel="noreferrer noopener">SVGOMG</a>) and CSS file using a VSCode extension.</li>
                    <li>Subsetted Typekit fonts to dispaly only Roman characters.</li>
                    <li>Implemented cachine. Holy hell was this hard to figure out. I presumed that I'd append it to my
                        <code>.htaccess</code> file, but none of the tutorials explicitly mentioned this.</li>
                    <li>Started the day with PageSpeed scores of 91 (mobile) and 94 (desktop). Ended at 98 and 100,
                        respectively!</li>
                </ul>

                    Accessibility</h3>
                <ul class="longform">
                    <li>Created <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> area with anchor links to help access information more fluidly.
                    </li>
                    <li>Replaced seasonless <code>&lt;divs&gt;</code> with semantic HTML. What a joy for screenreader
                        users to know the sections! I also had a revelation that <code>&lt;divs&gt;</code> should only
                        be used for things that have no content consequence. Said another way, if a section has meaning
                        from an information architecture perspective, it likely has a relevant semantic HTML tag. Taking
                        this approach, I think that <code>&lt;divs&gt;</code> should only have computational meaning; to
                        aid in m aking something look a certain way.</li>
                    <li>Rearranged and removed h tags that didn't make sense. Thanks to my super-smart friend <a
                            href="https://www.twitter.com/MarcySutton" class="t-link-accent-pink" target="_blank"
                            rel="noreferrer noopener">Marcy Sutton</a> for pointing this out. Remember kids, h tag order
                        is separate from your visual hierarchy. Don't use h tags to represent sizing; make that
                        agnostic.</li>
                    <li>Added Skip to content link with the help of my brilliant fren <a
                            href="https://www.twitter.com/ZoeBijl" class="t-link-accent-pink" target="_blank"
                            rel="noreferrer noopener">Zoe Bijl</a>.</li>
                    <li>Rewrote <code>alt</code> tags to be more about the content, and less formal analysis. We have a
                        tendency to overdescribe. Conciseness and clarity over comprehensiveness.</li>
